# Javascript Design Patterns

## Introduction

Design patterns are advanced object-oriented solutions to commonly occurring software problems. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects. Each pattern has a name and becomes part of a vocabulary when discussing complex design solutions.

The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural and Behavioral.

## Creational Patterns

| Name             | Description                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Abstract Factory | Creates an instance of several families of classes    |
| Builder          | Separates object construction from its representation |
| Factory Method   | Creates an instance of several derived classes        |
| Prototype        | A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned   |
| Singleton        | A class of which only a single instance can exist     |

## Structural Patterns

| Name      | Description                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adapter   | Match interfaces of different classes                   |
| Bridge    | Separates an object's interface from its implementation |
| Composite | A tree structure of simple and composite objects        |
| Decorator | Add responsibilities to objects dynamically             |
| Facade    | A single class that represents an entire subsystem      |
| Flyweight | A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing      |
| Proxy     | An object representing another object                   |

## Behavioral Patterns

| Name            | Description                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Chain of Resp   | A way of passing a request between a chain of objects |
| Command         | Encapsulate a command request as an object            |
| Interpreter     | A way to include language elements in a program       |
| Iterator        | Sequentially access the elements of a collection      |
| Mediator        | Defines simplified communication between classes      |
| Memento         | Capture and restore an object's internal state        |
| Observer        | A way of notifying changes to a number of classes     |
| State           | Alter an object's behavior then its state changes     |
| Strategy        | Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class              |
| Template Method | Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass   |
| Visitor         | Defines a new operation to a class without change     |
